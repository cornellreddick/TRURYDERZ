One percent motorcycle clubs originated from an event that took place in 1947. The Hollister Riot occurred in Hollister, California, during a Gypsy Tour race sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA). This incident led to the creation of the term “One-Percenters.” These clubs are considered to be part of the outlaw motorcycle club culture and make up less than 1% of all bikers in the US. .

As a member of a 1% club, you’re dedicated to biking and the brotherhood of your MC. You are expected to live within the confines of the law, but 1% MCs have in the past and continue still to break the law.
